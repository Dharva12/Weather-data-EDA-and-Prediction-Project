Sustainable development is a key part in the evolution and sustenance of the human kind. It is absolutely essential that we understand the consequences of our actions and pay attention the carbon emission and global warming national index.
Using Sustainable Power Generation sources like solar panels, wind mills, dams etc can be very beneficial in the future to convert our civilization into a carbon emission free planet. 
The objective of this project is to create a semantic segmentation model that can identify empty landmasses and regions accurately and efficiently while addressing the limitations of the conventional segmentation systems.
This project aims to use state-of-art algorithms and architectures that can handle challenges of identifying required landmasses that fit into our requirements using satellite imagery.
We were Able to successfully predict the metrics and train the model effectively in order to get the output of the states that would be the most viable for the installation of Solar Panels and Windmills (Sustainable sources of Energy).
